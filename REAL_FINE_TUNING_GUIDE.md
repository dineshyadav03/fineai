# üöÄ Real Fine-tuning with Cohere API - FULLY WORKING!

## ‚úÖ What's Now Working

Your FineAI platform is now configured for REAL fine-tuning with the Cohere API and all upload issues are resolved!

## üéØ How to Use Real Fine-tuning

### 1. Prepare Your Dataset

#### JSONL Format (Chat - RECOMMENDED for Cohere):
```jsonl
{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "What is AI?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "AI is artificial intelligence that simulates human thinking in machines."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "How does machine learning work?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Machine learning works by training algorithms on data to make predictions or decisions."}]}
```

#### CSV Format (Classification):
```csv
text,label
"This product is amazing! Love it",positive
"Terrible quality, waste of money",negative
```

#### Legacy Format (Auto-converted to Chat):
```jsonl
{"prompt": "What is the capital of France?", "completion": "The capital of France is Paris."}
{"prompt": "Explain photosynthesis", "completion": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to create glucose."}
```

### 2. Dataset Requirements

- Minimum: 2 examples (for testing)
- Recommended: 50+ examples for good performance
- Best results: 200+ examples
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Supported formats: .jsonl, .csv, .json

### 3. Upload Process

1. Go to Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. You'll see green banner: "Real Fine-tuning Enabled"
3. Upload your dataset file (drag & drop or click)
4. Wait for upload completion (usually 10-30 seconds)
5. Check "Your Datasets" section to see uploaded datasets

### 4. Create Fine-tuned Model

1. Select your uploaded dataset from the dropdown
2. Choose a model name (e.g., "Customer Support Bot")
3. Select base model: command, command-light, or command-r-plus
4. Click "Create Model"

### 5. Monitor Training

- Training typically takes 15-60 minutes (depends on dataset size)
- Model status will show: queued ‚Üí training ‚Üí completed
- Refresh the dashboard to see status updates
- You'll see your models in "Your Models" section

## üìã Example Files Available

- example-cohere-chat-dataset.jsonl - Perfect format for Cohere (RECOMMENDED)
- example-cohere-dataset.jsonl - Legacy format (auto-converted)
- test-dataset.csv - CSV classification example

## üîß Real API Features Now Active

- Real dataset uploads to Cohere (fixed API parameters)
- Actual fine-tuning jobs with real training
- Model status tracking via Cohere API
- Production-ready API calls with proper error handling
- File validation and format conversion
- Real-time progress monitoring

## üéØ Data Format Examples by Use Case:

### For Customer Support Chatbot:
```jsonl
{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "How do I reset my password?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "To reset your password: 1) Go to the login page, 2) Click 'Forgot Password', 3) Enter your email address, 4) Check your email for the reset link, 5) Follow the instructions in the email."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "What are your business hours?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Our business hours are Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM EST. We also offer 24/7 online chat support through our website."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "How can I track my order?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "You can track your order by: 1) Logging into your account, 2) Going to 'My Orders', 3) Clicking on the order number, 4) Viewing the tracking information. You'll also receive tracking emails automatically."}]}
```

### For Technical Documentation Assistant:
```jsonl
{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "How do I install the React package?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "To install React, run: `npm install react react-dom` for npm, or `yarn add react react-dom` for Yarn. Then import it in your code: `import React from 'react';`"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "What are the API rate limits?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "Our API rate limits are: Free tier - 100 requests per hour, Pro tier - 1,000 requests per hour, Enterprise tier - Custom limits based on your needs. Rate limit headers are included in all responses."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "How do I handle authentication?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "For authentication, include your API key in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`. All requests must be made over HTTPS. Your API key can be found in your dashboard settings."}]}
```

### For Content Classification:
```csv
text,label
"I love this new feature! It's exactly what I needed.",positive
"This update broke my workflow. Very disappointed.",negative
"The interface is clean and easy to use.",positive
"Loading times are too slow, needs improvement.",negative
"Great customer service, they helped me quickly.",positive
"Confusing navigation, hard to find what I need.",negative
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. API Costs: Real fine-tuning uses your Cohere credits (check your usage)
2. Training Time: Larger datasets take longer to train (15-60 minutes typical)
3. Quality Matters: Better formatted data = better model performance
4. Testing: Always test your model thoroughly before production use
5. Format: Chat format (messages) works best with Cohere API

## üõ† Technical Details (What We Fixed)

### API Parameter Issue Resolved:
- Problem: "name param must be set" error
- Cause: Cohere API expects query parameters, not FormData fields
- Solution: Send name and type as URL parameters
- Result: Uploads now work perfectly

### Dataset Type Corrected:
- Problem: Wrong dataset type for conversational data
- Solution: Use chat-finetune-input for prompt/completion data
- Result: API accepts and processes uploads correctly

### File Validation Enhanced:
- Empty file detection
- Size limit checking (10MB max)
- Format validation
- Content verification

## üöÄ Ready to Start!

Your platform is now production-ready for real AI fine-tuning:

1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. Sign in with demo credentials (any email + 6+ char password)
3. Upload one of the example files to test
4. Create your first fine-tuned model
5. Monitor the training progress
6. Use your custom model via Cohere API

## üí° Pro Tips:

1. **Start with example files** to verify everything works
2. **Use chat format** for best results with Cohere
3. **Keep prompts and completions balanced** in length
4. **Include diverse examples** for better generalization
5. **Test with small datasets** first before large uploads

## üîß API Usage After Training:

Once your model is trained, use it like this:

```python
import cohere
co = cohere.Client('your-api-key')

response = co.chat(
    model='your-fine-tuned-model-id',
    message='Your question here'
)
print(response.text)
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

Upload fails:
- Check file size (must be < 10MB)
- Verify file format and content
- Try one of the example files first

Model creation fails:
- Ensure dataset uploaded successfully
- Check Cohere API key is valid
- Verify you have sufficient Cohere credits

Training stuck:
- Training can take 15-60 minutes
- Check Cohere dashboard for detailed status
- Refresh FineAI dashboard for updates
